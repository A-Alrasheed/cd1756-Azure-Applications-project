### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

I chose App Service since there is no need for specific infrastructure nor it's goining to scale in future, hence the use of Azure Virtual Machine.
App Service is faster to deploy require less effort to manage than Azure Virtual Machine.


### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

If the app needed a specific infrastrucure or require manageing low level components like networks and middlewares then Azure Virtual Machine will be the logical choice.
